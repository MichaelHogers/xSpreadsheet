This example app is designed for end-to-end tests. To interact with the spreadsheet, we manually position the cursor at a specific gridpoint because interacting directly with the canvas is not easily achievable. As a workaround, we maximize the spreadsheet within the viewport, ensuring that all clicks are guaranteed to interact with a cell. To run the tests, use the command npx playwright test and refer to the file tests/playwright/e2e.spec.js for more details. We click buttons below the spreadsheet via playwright and assert that correct values are returned in the UI.
