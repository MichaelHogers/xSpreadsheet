# xSpreadsheet 2.1.1.7

* Known issues:
- Merged cells cause a failure when saving spreadsheet state and reloading ->
maybe the saved JSON object is incomplete wrst merged cells.
- Filter menu does not fit if the spreadsheet height is too small

* Working towards a new release.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
